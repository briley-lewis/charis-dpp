I. Setup
 you need ...
- the distributed CHARIS-DPP package
- a reasonably current version of the IDL Astronomy Library
- an IDL license

For some programs to work (e.g. charis_newobs), you need an active Internet connection, as these programs query SIMBAD and VIZIER

II. Installation

To set up this package you need to ...

1. Copy entire zip'd package to your preferred directory path: (e.g. cp [package_version].zip [your/preferred/path/])

2. Unzip the package (i.e. cd to [your/preferred/path/] and then "unzip [package_version].zip" from Terminal command line)

3.  Add that directory path to your IDL PATH

e.g. if your directory is charis_dpp_v7 then in tcsh (.cshrc)
setenv IDL_PATH +$IDL_DIR/lib:+$HOME/[your/preferred/path/charis_dpp_v7]:

4. under the "setup" subdirectory, edit line 11 of charis_path.pro, to change the directory path to your full charis PATH
(e.g. if you unpack this package as charis_dpp_v7, then do the following:
 charispath='[path to CHARIS-DPP]/charis_dpp_v7/'   )


III. Verification
To verify correct installation, run 'charis_test' at IDL prompt
