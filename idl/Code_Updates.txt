;Version 7.1 - May 15, 2021
***Changes Made ***
Tools
 - includes "atmosfit" program to simultaneously fit CHARIS spectra and photometric points with BT-Settl models
Partial Sub/Psfsub
- saving coefficients is nominally *turned off*: forward-modeling does not require saved coefficients. Impact: faster forward-modeling, otherwise no effect.
- restructured forward-modeling into a series of 'case' statements to fwd-model, ADI, SDI, ADI-p-SDI, and SDI-p-ADI
- both ALOCI and KLIP fully updated
Psfsub
 - updated ADI-ALOCI, SDI-ALOCI codes
 - can now do ADI on SDI residuals with ALOCI
Reg
 - updated PSFquality check
Specphotcal 
 - added ability to calibrate cube off of results of another cube (calmethod=5) (charis_specphotcal.pro)  (charis_specphotcal.pro.bk is old version)
 - updated spectral extraction for disk sources (charis_extract_1d_spectrum_disk.pro)
 - updated astrometry grid search for extended sources/sources in disks
PDI
- now "largely complete" PDI pipeline (K. Lawson)


;Version 7.0 - December 31, 2020

***Changes Made ***
Added 'test' subdirectory and "charis_test.pro" [to test correct installation path] and "charis_which.pro" [to find paths of your programs]

PSF subtraction programs
-PSF subtraction programs (throughout) calls to 'myaper' --> 'charis_myaper' to avoid collisions and make distribution self-contained
-renamed charis_subsklip and charis_subsklip_rdi to charis_adiklip and charis_rdiklip
-branched off separate proprietary version of A-LOCI ADI & SDI code for T.C. and later for internal team distribution only

Analysis
-slight changes to determination of band-integrated photometry in charis_est_bbphot.pro

charis_specphot_cal-
-small changes to calculation of spectrophotometric errors to better reflect accuracy of satellite spot contrast.
**********

;Version 6.1 - October 6, 2020

***
Changes Made

- charis_autoreduce 
Does an automatic reduction -- "start to finish" -- of CHARIS data.   Appropriate for quick-look reductions.
***

;Version 6 - August 2020
******Scripts

*******Setup

-charis_path.pro
 changed path for Montreal library to agree with DPP-distributed Montreal library path

- charis_get_constant.pro
changed pixscale to 0.0162
added "angoffset" constant: now required for PSF subtraction routines
 ***To Do *** figure out how to package the SPeX library
 
*******Prelims

-charis_newobs.pro 
changed SIMBAD target search to match HCI general purpose code version: more robust against SIMBAD's string parsing errors.
added help function

-charis_imprep.pro
added help function and documentation
added frame selection function to set fnum_sat and fnum_sky.  
****TO DO **** figure out way to set the ladder?


******Sky****
-charis_subtract_sky.pro
added help function and documentation

*****Reg****
-charis_register_cube.pro
changed from charis_imregister_cube to charis_register_cube
removed many commented-out lines/debugging notes
put method switch as 0, 1, and 2 [sats, psf, calsat]
help documentation added

*******Specphotcal

- charis_specphot_cal.pro : code cleaned up, help function updated
- charis_specphot_cal_unsat.pro : ditto
- charis_makeemppsf: ditto
- charis_makesynthpsf: ditto
- charis_satspot_cal: ditto
- charis_extract_1d_spectrum: cleaned up code, help function updated

****Filt***
-charis_imrsub.pro
added help function and documentation

****PSFsub***
- charis_ssdi: code cleaned up, now rotates everything to northup; help function updated
- charis_subsklip: ditto
- charis_subsklip_rdi: ditto
- charis_sublocirx: ditto
- charis_sdialoci: updated "north-up" procedure to agree with ADI/KLIP & ALOCI codes

- renamed charis_sublocirx as charis_adialoci [more logical naming]

***PartialSub***


******Planetspec
- charis_planet_photometric_calibration_calculation: now can read in both FITS files (wvlh, f, are array=[*,0] and [*,1], respectively) and txt files (readcol)
- try testing both for robustness

******Tools
*empcomp
- some improvement in charis_empbdplanspec.pro
- added help function and documentation to charis_est_lum_bd.pro
*psf/diskanalysis/imagequality
- added charis_resample_psf.pro - program to resample an image from another source (e.g. input a scaled HiCIAO or NIRC2 image to the CHARIS scale)
- added charis_diskmodel_resample.pro -program to resample model disk (similar to above)
- added documentation to charis_calc_ee.pro

***to do ***-
figure out longest dimension and then read in appropriately to get wavelength and flux


subroutines
- copied working version of hrot2 to "subroutines" folder to guard against crashes
